# How to Play
To play the game, simply hit any letter on your keyboard. If the hidden word contains the letter, the letter will be displayed. However, if the word does not include that letter, then your number of guesses will go down. In order to win, you must guess all of the letters in the hidden word before your number of guesses left hits 0. Once you either correctly guess the word or run out of guesses, the program will initialize a new game.
